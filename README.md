# Michigan Crime, Michigan Unemployment, MI Population, US Population  Datasets
The first question we analyzed was looking into how Michigan’s unemployment rates affect Michigan’s crime rate. We wanted to explore if there is any relationship/association between these two variables. This is an important question because if there is a relationship between Michigan’s unemployment and crime rates, this information can be used to develop policies that reduce crime and improve Michigan’s economic conditions. For example, if unemployment has a strong relationship with crime rates, then policies around job training programs and targeting reducing unemployment should be created. The results to this question can make it possible to reduce Michigan’s crime rates more effectively rather than by simply focusing on Michigan’s police force.
To answer this question, we first used data on Michigan’s crime rates per 100k people and combined it with data on Michigan’s population to obtain the percentage of crime rates in Michigan throughout the years. Afterwards, we combined this data with data on Michigan’s unemployment rates from 1979 onwards. Next, we performed a linear regression on the data looking at how Michigan’s unemployment rate predicts the state’s crime rate. Likewise, we decided to do a simple correlation on these two variables to get further support regarding the strength of their relationship.
